        # HTML Semantic Elements:
        -------------------------
        Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

        ## What are Semantic Elements?
        ------------------------------
        - A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
        - Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
        - Examples of semantic elements: <img>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

        # HTML Entities:
        ----------------
        Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with entities:
        < (less than) = &lt;
        > (greater than) = &gt;
        
        ## HTML Character Entities:
        ---------------------------
        - Some characters are reserved in HTML.
        - If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.
        - Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.

        ** Entity names look like this:
        &entity_name;
        
        ** Entity numbers look like this:
        &#entity_number;
        
        To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;

        # The HTML charset Attribute:
        -----------------------------
        To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.

        ** This is specified in the <meta> tag:
        <meta charset="UTF-8">

        ** If not specified, UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML.

        ## UTF-8 Characters:
        --------------------
        - Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using numbers (called entity numbers):

        A is 65
        B is 66
        C is 67
        
        Example:
        --------
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <body>

        <p>I will display A B C</p>
        <p>I will display &#65; &#66; &#67;</p>

        </body>
        </html>

        Example Explained:
        ------------------
        - The <meta charset="UTF-8"> element defines the character set.
        - The characters A, B, and C, are displayed by the numbers 65, 66, and 67.
        - To let the browser understand that you are displaying a character, you must start the entity number with &# and end it with ; (semicolon).

        # The ASCII Character Set:
        --------------------------
        ASCII was the first character encoding standard for the web. It defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet:

        English letters (A-Z)
        Numbers (0-9)
        Special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < >.

        ## HTML Uniform Resource Locators:
        ----------------------------------
        - A URL is another word for a web address.
        - A URL can be composed of words (e.g. w3schools.com), or an Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g. 192.68.20.50).
        - Most people enter the name when surfing, because names are easier to remember than numbers.

        ## URL - Uniform Resource Locator:
        ----------------------------------
        - Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.
        - A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to address a document (or other data) on the web.

        scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename

        Explanation:
        ------------
        . scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
        . prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)
        . domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)
        . port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)
        . path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)
        . filename - defines the name of a document or resource

        ## URL Encoding:
        ----------------
        - URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. If a URL contains characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted.
        - URL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.
        - URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.
        - URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20.

        ## HTML Versus XHTML:
        ---------------------
        - XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML.

        ** What is XHTML?
        -----------------
        . XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
        . XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML
        . XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
        . XHTML is supported by all major browsers

        ## Why XHTML?
        -------------
        - XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").
        - XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML).
          In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup.
          So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.

        # The Most Important Differences from HTML:
        -------------------------------------------
        . <!DOCTYPE> is mandatory
        . The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
        . <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory
        . Elements must always be properly nested
        . Elements must always be closed
        . Elements must always be in lowercase
        . Attribute names must always be in lowercase
        . Attribute values must always be quoted
        . Attribute minimization is forbidden

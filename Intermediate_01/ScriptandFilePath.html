        JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.

        # The HTML <script> Tag:
        ------------------------
        - The HTML <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).
        - The <script> element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.
        - Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
        - To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method.

        ** This JavaScript example writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":

        Example:
        --------
        <script>
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
        </script>

        Example:
        --------
        JavaScript can change styles:

        document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "25px";
        document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "red";
        document.getElementById("demo").style.backgroundColor = "yellow";

        Example:
        --------
        JavaScript can change attributes:

        document.getElementById("image").src = "picture.gif";

        # The HTML <noscript> Tag:
        --------------------------
        - The HTML <noscript> tag defines an alternate content to be displayed to users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support scripts:

        Example:
        --------
        <script>
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
        </script>
        
        <noscript>Sorry, your browser does not support JavaScript!</noscript>

        # HTML File Paths:
        ------------------
        - A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.

        File paths are used when linking to external files, like:

        . Web pages
        . Images
        . Style sheets
        . JavaScripts

        ## Types of Path:
        -----------------
        1. Absolute
        2. Relative

        Absolute File Paths:
        --------------------
        - An absolute file path is the full URL to a file.

        Example:
        --------
        <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

        Relative File Paths:
        --------------------
        - A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.

        ** In the following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level up from the current folder:

        Example
        <img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

        * Best Practice is to use the relative path as much as possible.
